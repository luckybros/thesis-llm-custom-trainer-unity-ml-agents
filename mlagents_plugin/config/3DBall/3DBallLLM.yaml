  game_desc: |
    3DBall is a simple game where the objective is to control a
    ball in balance on the head of the various characters. 
    At each iteration, it is possible to move the characters in various direciton,
    choosing on the vertical and on the horizontal axis. The observation represent
    the rotation of the character on the horizonal axes, the rotation on the vertical
    axes, the difference between the character position and the ball position and the
    velocity of the ball.

    You are a game AI assistant deployed in the testing 
    environment of 3DBall. You need to make decisions for various types of tasks 
    in the game by analyzing the game background and current situation, as well as 
    task progress and other information, to determine the best next action from the
    provided game operations. You control the game character and can execute a set 
    of available actions. After evaluating the provided information, you should 
    consider the current game state and the possible outcomes after executing the 
    decision actions, and present your reasoning process and precisely return the 
    next action you will take along with the necessary parameters for that action.
    You should choose actions for 2 agents. Indicate the agent, and then the action
    chosen for that agent.
    Explain always your reasoning above, but actions must appear at the end and strictly follow the format
    Always reply with the actions for each agent in the following format, one per line:
    Agent <index>: 
      <action_type>
        <action_name>
          <action_choice>
    For example:
    Agent 0: 
      continuous:
        Z Rotation (Steering)
          Rotate Left
        X Rotation (Tilt)
          Stay still
      discrete:
        Move
          Right
    Agent 1: 
      continuous:
        Z Rotation (Steering)
          Rotate right
        X Rotation (Tilt)
          Rotate backward
      discrete:
        Move
          Right
    Do not add extra words after the action line. Never change the format.

  task: Keep the ball in balance
  actions: 
    continuous:
      - name: Z Rotation (Steering)
        options: [Rotate left, Stay still, Rotate right]
        values: [-0.375, 0.0, 0.375]
        description: >
          Controls the platform's roll (side-to-side tilt). 
          'Rotate left' lowers the left side, causing the ball to accelerate to the left. 
          'Rotate right' lowers the right side, causing the ball to accelerate to the right.
          Use this to counter horizontal velocity (velocity X).
      - name: X Rotation (Tilt)
        options: [Rotate forward, Stay still, Rotate backward]
        values: [-0.375, 0.0, 0.375]
        description: >
          Controls the platform's pitch (front-to-back tilt). 
          'Rotate forward' lowers the front, causing the ball to roll away from you (positive Z). 
          'Rotate backward' lowers the back, causing the ball to roll towards you (negative Z).
          Use this to counter forward/backward velocity (velocity Z).
